# Downdload transcripts of YouTube videos

One of the best ways of getting the content of YouTube videos is to get their closed captions (i.e. transcripts).
I wrote this simple script to get video transcripts via scraping, as opposed to the API.

## Usage

To get the transcript of a video using its video id use the -v flag (or --videoId for):

```
python3 cc.py -v JDdofhgw04o
```

This will download the transcript as a .txt file to the same directory.

For videos that have transcripts available in multiple languages, you need to specify which transcript you want.
You can specify either the name of the language or its abbreviated form.

For example, to download the German closed captions for the video ZCFkWDdmXG8:

```
python3 cc.py -v ZCFkWDdmXG8 -c de
python3 cc.py -v ZCFkWDdmXG8 -l german 
```

The --meta flag stores an additional .json file with some meta data about the download. This might especially come in handy when there are errors, because it tells what kind of an error was encountered.

For example, the following will not store a transcript, but will store a json file that indicates that "This video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated."

```
python3 cc.py -v u7HOnT9FLwE --meta 
```

The --meta flag also shows whether the caption was automatically generated by YouTube or if it was uploaded by creator. The program always prefers the creator uploaded transcripts to those that are automatically generated, if both are available for a given language.
